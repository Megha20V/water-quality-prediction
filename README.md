# Water Quality Prediction - RMS

This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically MultiOutputRegressor wrapped around a RandomForestRegressor.

# Overview

Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

# Technologies Used

    -Python 3.12
    -Pandas, NumPy – Data handling
    -Scikit-learn – Machine learning model and evaluation
    -Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization


# Model Performance

The model was evaluated using:

    -R² Score
    -Mean Squared Error (MSE)
